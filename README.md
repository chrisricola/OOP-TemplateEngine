# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

I started by filling out the javacript formulas for the files under lib folder. Starting with the "Employee.js". I built the class that has the constructor for the names, id's and emails. Then I filled out the files for the engineer and interns adding the the Employee class. Engineer is adding a github, while the intern is adding the school attended. Then I ran the test and completed after all the test passed. 


All three are then exported. In app.js is where they all come together. With require, I built different questions, starting with the manager,and then adding to engineer and intern. When running the node, the questions are asking the manager about entering a new employee. The functions prompts the questions from the and the data is recieved from the information of the classes in the seperate js files. Finally all the information is rendered into the html file.

Run npm intall for require.

There's an instructional video showing the process and final result.
